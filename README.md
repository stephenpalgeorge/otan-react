# ORANGUTAN REACT (OTAN-REACT)

*Orangutan React is helpful.*
Almost every react project involves creating some sort of library of components.
The number of ways that you can structure and organise your code is limited mostly
by your imagination. Orangutan React has an opinion on how to do this and it'll
take care of the boilerplate for you.

The concept is simple, a 'library' directory that houses all your components, grouped
into a selection of sub directories. Orangutan also makes some assumptions, the most
important one is probably that it expects you to be using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/, "sass-lang") for your styles.
Future versions will hopefully support other css tools, or even none at all.

## Atomic design

The organisation of orangutan components is based on atomic design principles. You can
create a directory of protons, atoms, molecules, organisms and layouts (sorry this
one doesn't quite fit the naming pattern..!). By default, orangutan recommends atoms,
molecules and organisms.

**Atoms** are small units of reusable UI, typical examples would be Button, Title,
Image. **Molecules** bring two or more atoms together, so a Card molecule might comprise
Title, Text and a couple of Button atoms. **Organisms** bring two or more molecules, or
a combinaton of molecules and atoms together, so a Hero organism might comprise an
Image atom and a Card molecule.

## Getting started

Either install otan-react globally or run the commands using npx. The examples below
assume a global installation, but you can read more about npx [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx, "npx")

`npm i -g otan-react` installs otan-react globally, so you can run it from anywhere in
your command line. Once it's installed you can run `otan-react` to see some introductory
information and a list of available commands.

### Commands

#### Setup

```javascript
otan-react setup
```

This is the first command you'll want to run for a new project. You should run this from the
directory where you want to your component library to be generated. Orangutan will check the
location with you before it does anything, so just say no and cd into the right place before
running the command again if you need to.

You can also run the command with a "name" argument. This will be useful if you want to create more
than one library in a project, or if you are introducing otan-react to a project that already has a
"library" directory. You can run the command like this (where "portfolio" is an example of a library
name, you can call yours whatever you want):

```javascript
otan-react setup --name portfolio
```

or like this:

```javascript
otan-react setup -n portfolio
```

If you don't provide a name, it will default to "library". All the following example code assumes
the default name.

Next, you can choose which directories you want to be included in your library. Let's assume you
have a src directory where all your application code is stored, you run `otan-react setup` and
accept all the defaults, orangutan will scaffold the following file structure for you:

```text
src/
|-- /library
|--|-- /01-atoms
|--|--|-- index.js
|--|-- /02-protons
|--|--|-- index.js
|--|-- /03-organisms
|--|--|-- index.js
|--| data.js
|--| index.js
|--| library.scss
```

*library/index.js* - this file imports and exports all of your components from each atomic
directory. This means consuming your components is really easy, something like this (imagine
we're working in src/HomePage.js):

```javascript
// src/HomePage.js

import React from 'react'
// import components from your otan-react
// component library. Adjust the file path
// to the library as required
import { HeroBanner, PageTitle, Button } from './library'
```

*library/library.scss* - this file imports all of the sass partials in your components. For
your component styles to make it into your app code, you'll need to import this file somewhere.
Let's assume you have an index.scss file in your project root that gets imported in the entry point
js file:

```css
// /index.scss

@import './src/styles/global-styles.scss';
// load all of your loris component styles
@import './src/library/library.scss';
```

From here on in, you can create your components manually if you want, but orangutan will write
the boilerplate for you if you ask it to.

---

#### New

```javascript
otan-react new
```

This command generates a new React Component. Orangutan assumes you're using modern react features
like hooks, so all components will be created as functional components, but you can obviously
rewrite any of this code and use classes if you'd prefer.

**What happens when I generate a new component with the CLI?**
Orangutan will create a folder within the desired components directory (atoms, molecules etc). You
can choose which files to include (more information on these later) and loris will generate
them for you.
On top of this, loris will write your new component to that directory's index.js, to the
library's index.js and (if you chose to include a sass file) it will write an import
statement to the library/library.scss file.

So let's suppose you ran the command, chose to creat the component in library/01-atoms and
gave it the name "Button", you would now have something like this:

```text
src/
|-- /library
|--|-- /01-atoms
|--|--|-- /Button
|--|--|--|-- Button.js
|--|--|--|-- data.js
|--|--|--|-- _button.scss
|--|--|--|-- button.test.js
|--|--|-- index.js
|--|-- /02-protons
|--|--|-- index.js
|--|-- /03-organisms
|--|--|-- index.js
|--| index.js
|--| library.scss
```

The files *library/01-atoms/index.js* && *library/index.js* will now include an import statement for Button and
an export object that includes Button. The file *library/library.scss* will now include an import statement for
01-atoms/Button/button.

#####Â Component Files

When you generate a new component, Orangutan will ask you which files you want to include. You can choose any or all
of 'js', 'sass', 'data', 'test'. Some of these are more obvious than others, but here follows a brief explanation
of what each file does:

##### JS - component javascript file

This is the basic .js file that will create your react component. You can of course create more files in this
directory if you want to break your component out across two or three different files, but be aware that, by
default, Loris only imports this generated JS file, so if you do add your own you will need to import them in
this javascript file.

##### SASS - component styles

This is where you would put any component-specific styles. *N.B. this file is not imported in the component
JS file but is included instead in the library/library.scss file.* I think this makes it easier to keep
track of the cascade as you will be include all component styles as one either before or (probably) after
any global styles you have written.

##### DATA - props values

Data files are a pattern that Orangutan encourages. They are basically a separate file for housing all of your
props values for a particular component. Then, when you consume the component, you can also import the component's
data file and pass the object straight down. I think this helps with maintainability as well.

*N.B. data files are probably not useful if you're making a component library that you intend to publish,
since third-party consumers of your library won't have read and write access to this file.* Data files are
intended for a project where your components library is contained within the application's codebase.

Here's a couple of examples:

Suppose this component:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

const TextBlock = ({
    heading,
    body
}) => {
    return (
        <div className="text-block">
            <h2>{ heading }</h2>
            <p>{ body }</p>
        </div>
    )
}

TextBlock.propTypes = {
    heading: PropTypes.string,
    body: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

export default TextBlock
```

You can see we have defined two props, "heading" and "body". Now let's write our data file for this component:

```javascript
const data = {
    heading: "Otan React Component Library",
    body: "Otan-react is designed to help you quickly scaffold and generate React component libraries."
}

export default data
```

Now, when you come to use the TextBlock component you can do this:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

import { TextBlock } from './library'
import { TextBlockData } from './library/data'

const HomePage = () => (
    <div>
        <TextBlock {...TextBlockData} />
    </div>
)
```

It doesn't look like much at the moment, but imagine if TextBlock had a dozen props, and 3 of them were
long file paths to images/assets, and the "body" prop text was a couple of hundred words long! Keeping it
all together makes sense.
But, you're probably going to want to use your components in more than just the once place, with more than
one set of data! There are probably a few ways that you could structure this code, but I reckon it makes
most sense just to nest some more objects inside of your data object. Like:

```javascript
const data = {
    homepage: {
        heading: "Loris React Component Library",
        body: "Loris-react is designed to help you quickly scaffold and generate React component libraries."
    },
    aboutpage: {
        heading: "This is the about page",
        body: "The data is different but we've stored it under an intuitively named property of our data object"
    }
}

export default data
```

Now when you're consuming your data, something like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

import { TextBlock } from './library'
import { TextBlockData } from './library/data'

const HomePage = () => (
    <div>
        // now we specifically target the homepage
        // property of our data object
        <TextBlock {...TextBlockData.homepage} />
    </div>
)
```

#### DELETE

```javascript
otan-react delete
```

Running this command starts an interactive traversal of the libraries file structure. You
can select the component you want to delete, Orangutan will ask you to confirm, and then remove
that component's directory. This will also trigger a "rebuild" of all of the index files to ensure
that all references to this component are removed within the library itself.

---

#### REBUILD

```javascript
otan-react rebuild
```

Running this command triggers a re-writing of all of the "index" files:

- \[atomicDir\]/index.js
- \[libraryName\]/index.js
- \[libraryName\]/data.js
- \[libraryName\]/library.scss

---

#### VERSION

Check what version of otan-react you have installed by running `otan-react --version` or
`loris-react -v`. To see a list of commands in the command line, just run `otan-react` with
no arguments, or run `otan-react info`.

---

#### TEST

If you've used create-react-app you'll have jest (and a test script) ready to go, so these files
should just work. Out of the box Otan just writes a simple test that checks your component will
successfully render to the DOM, obivously you should add many more of your own tests to this file!
